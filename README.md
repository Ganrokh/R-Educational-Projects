# R-Educational-Projects
Projects showing understanding of R development. I tried learning R and Python at once. Not long after, I decided to pause R and focus on Python.
I have a much better understanding of Python now at the the time of this writing (November 24th, 2020).
I plan on going back to R eventually.
